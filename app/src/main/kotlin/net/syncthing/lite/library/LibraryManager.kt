/**
 * This class manages the access to an LibraryInstance
 *
 * Users can get an instance with startLibraryUsage()
 * If they are done with it, the should call stopLibraryUsage()
 * After this, it's NOT safe to continue using the received LibraryInstance
 *
 * Every call to startLibraryUsage should be followed by an call to stopLibraryUsage,
 * even if the callback was not called yet. It can still be called, so users should watch out.
 *
 * All listeners are executed at the UI Thread (except the synchronousInstanceCreator)
 *
 * The userCounterListener is always called before the isRunningListener
 *
 * The listeners are called for all changes, nothing is skipped or batched
